# Six Steps

> ## Problem:[DFS and BFS](https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/1260)
>
> ### 1. Understanding problem
> Print order of visiting nodes using DFS and BFS for a given graph.
> ### 2. Redefining a problem
> For given N, M, V (1 <= N <= 1000), (1 <= M <= 10000), (1 <= V <= 1000) which N is number of nodes,
> M is number of roads between nodes, V is starting node.  
> Find order of visiting nodes using DFS and BFS.
> ### 3. Making a plan
> We can solve this problem just using DFS and BFS.
> ### 4. Validate a plan
> Time complexity of making graph is O(N ^ 2 + M) and DFS and BFS are both O(N ^ 2).
> Since N is under 1000 and M is under 10000, we have enough time to calculate.
> ### 5. Implement
> Here is my first code using DFS and BFS.
