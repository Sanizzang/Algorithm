# Algorithm

> ## Purpose & Goal
> `Purpose` is studying a lot of algorithm problems in terms of dynamic programming, graph, tree etc.  
> indeed, I whis this PS would be a good practice to get a job at the **largest tech compaines** as well as
> solving more than 1500 algorithm problems provided by Backjun to be in the top 1000.
> 
> Especially, one of my `goals` is getting to the World Finals at Codejam. Some people wanna be adept at discrete mathematics 
> whenever they solve algorithm problems or working on something related to software engineering. so this project gonna give them
> mathematical thinking by solving somoe PS.

## How the project will work

> #### There are four steps that we have to know
>
>
>> 1. Solving problems of which part are random and it gonna be saved each folder related to the part. You have to name description file(its explained below) as "D_your name.md" also, your program for a problem has to be "your name.exe"
>> 2. Each problem has to be written with given a 6 steps file. 
>>	
```						  
							* Six Steps *
					1. Reading a problem and understand what it means
					2. Redefine a problem with some mathematical terms
					3. Make a plan to solve it. Here you should choose what data structure or algorithm you gonna use
					4. Validate a Plan, especially, induction or deduction, mathematical ways have to be used
					5. Implement it as a program
					6. Find out how it can be improved or explain how your system works 
```
>>
>> 3. After solving a problem, review your code or other yourself such that you describe how your system works or how you can improve your programming or other in terms of efficiency and readability etc.

>> 4. Here is my [discord server](https://discord.gg/f3trPxu), join here :D

>> @ this is the [example](https://github.com/DevStevenLee/Algorithm/tree/master/BinarySearch/WeightLimit_1939) for this step.
>>
>>
>> @ Caution
1. There are the forms bout git message. If you solve a problem, then git message should be "Resolving (folder/\*\*\*/problem_name) by whom". If you improve a code, then, it should be "Improving (folder/\*\*\*/problem_name) by whom". If you do a review, then it should be "Comment (folder/\*\*\*/problem_name) by whom" If you fix some bugs, then it should be "Fix (folder/\*\*\*/problem_name) about a content of bugs by whom". Remember when you commit something, only execution file and description has to be added !!!

>>
>> 2. If there is a problem you cant solve even if you spend time more than 48 hours.. then, you gotta write bout how other's code works in 6 step of a description.

>> 3. One meeting on Sunday
>> <br />
>> 4. Solving 3 problems and 3 comments for a week.
