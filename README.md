# Algorithm

> ## Purpose & Goal
> `Purpose` is studying a lot of algorithm problems in terms of dynamic programming, graph, tree etc.  
> indeed, I whis this PS would be a good practice to get a job at the **largest tech compaines** as well as
> solving more than 1500 algorithm problems provided by Backjun to be in the top 1000.
> 
> Especially, one of my `goals` is getting to the World Finals at Codejam. Some people wanna be adept at discrete mathematics 
> whenever they solve algorithm problems or working on something related to software engineering. so this project gonna give them
> mathematical thinking by solving somoe PS.
