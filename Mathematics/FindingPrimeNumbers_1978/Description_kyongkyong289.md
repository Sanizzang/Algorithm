# Six Steps

> ## Problem:[Finding Prime Numbers](https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/1978)
>
> ### 1. Understanding problem
> Find number of prime numbers in given N numbers.
> ### 2. Redefining a problem
> For given N numbers, (1 <= N <= 100), find number of prime numbers, each numbers are between 1 and 1000 inclusively.
> ### 3. Making a plan
> For each numbers, we just divide a number by 2 from n - 1. If the number is divided by any of these, the number is not prime number.  
> If we find a prime number, then we can just simply add 1 to counter.
> ### 4. Validate a plan
> Time complexity is O(N), since N is small, we have enough time to calculate.
> ### 5. Implement
